# Convolution and Pooling operations from scratch

Vector implementation of convolution and max pooling layer

* These can not be used to build a neural network! -> Neural networks use matrix operations
* Numpy will be used to implement from scratch
* To give a better illustration famous Lenna image and Gabor filters will be used
* If you want to learn matrix implementation please visit: https://github.com/berkedilekoglu/convolution_numpy

I highly recommend you to read this tutorial:

https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/

If you read and follow that course step by step with imptlementation you can understand the magic behind convolutional neural networks!
